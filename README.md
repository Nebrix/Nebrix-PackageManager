# Warp Installation Guide

## Building for Your System
If you are using any system, you can compile Warp using the following command:
```
go build -o warp main.go
```
Create an alias for your executable with the following command:
```
alias warp='~/path/to/your/executable/warp'
```

This will compile and build Warp for your system.
